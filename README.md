# üìö Doc Siofbq - AI Research Assistant

[![Streamlit App](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://your-deployed-app-url.onrender.com) <!-- Replace with your actual deployed URL -->

An interactive Streamlit application designed to assist with research by leveraging the power of AI for web searching, content summarization, annotation generation, and organized storage.

This tool allows users to:
*   Enter research queries.
*   Search the web for relevant sources using the Tavily Search API.
*   Generate concise summaries of search results using Google's Gemini model.
*   Create annotated bibliography entries based on the summaries.
*   Save interesting findings (URL, title, summary, annotation, original query) to a persistent library.
*   Organize saved items into custom folders.
*   Maintain a chat history for the research session.

All library data and chat history are stored persistently using Redis (specifically configured for Upstash).
